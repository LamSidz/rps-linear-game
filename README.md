# rps-linear-game
This is a rock-paper-scissors tile game for our linear algebra class.

#how it works
Players take turns putting tiles of their color onto the board. Once each player has placed 5, the game will start.
When a tile is surrounded by 3 or more of its enemy tile (for example 3 yellows around a pink, but not 3 pinks around a yellow), the surrounded tile changes color.
After a set amount of time, if a winner is not evident, players should pause (perhaps randomly to make it fair), and see which color takes up the most space.
Players can press e to pause or play at any time, even when not all turns have been taken.
